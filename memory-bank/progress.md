## Phase 2: Text & Multi-Select Polish (NOT STARTED)

### Scope (High-Level)

- [ ] Rotation handles for all shapes
- [ ] Rotation with preview system
- [ ] Keyboard shortcut polish

### Phase 2 Acceptance Criteria (Reference)
- [ ] Text editing reliable and intuitive
- [ ] Peers see editing state and final text
- [ ] Multi-select transforms remain smooth
- [ ] Large selections don't blow RTDB budget
- [ ] Rotation behaves like move/resize with previews

## Known Issues & Blockers

### Current Blockers
- None (project not yet started)

### Anticipated Challenges
1. **Tuning preview throttle**: Will need empirical testing to find optimal values
2. **Large selection performance**: Centroid-only fallback logic needs careful design
3. **Cursor label overlap**: Anti-overlap algorithm may be tricky
4. **Version conflict UX**: Need to ensure rubber-banding doesn't feel jarring
5. **Firebase quotas**: Free tier limits may be reached during testing

### Deferred for Future
- Mobile optimization beyond basic functionality
- Offline mode support
- Rich text editing
- Advanced layers panel
- Permissions beyond "unlisted link" model
- Canvas export (PNG, SVG)
- Collaborative cursors during text editing

## Feature Tier Reference (from Performance Requirements)

### Tier 1 (Must Have - Phase 1)
- ✅ Undo/redo with keyboard shortcuts (Cmd+Z / Cmd+Shift+Z)
- ✅ Keyboard shortcuts for common actions (Delete, Duplicate, Arrow keys to move)

### Tier 2 (Should Have - Future)
- Layers panel with drag-to-reorder and hierarchy
- Z-index management (bring to front, send to back)

### Tier 3 (Nice to Have - Future)
- Copy/paste functionality

## Testing Status

### Unit Tests
- Not started (0%)

### Integration Tests
- Not started (0%)

### E2E Tests

### Manual Testing Scenarios (Phase 1)
From performance requirements document:

- [ ] Rapid Edit Storm: One resizes, another changes color, another moves
- [ ] Delete vs Edit: One deletes while another edits
- [ ] Create Collision: Two users create objects simultaneously
- [ ] Mid-Operation Refresh: Refresh during drag
- [ ] Total Disconnect: All users disconnect, return after 2 min
- [ ] Network Simulation: Network throttled to 0 for 30s, then restored
- [ ] Rapid Disconnect: Rapid edits followed by tab close
