# Handoff Summary — Phase 1 Steps 7–9

## Current Status

- No production-ready code changes were committed for Steps 7 (Resize & Duplicate), 8 (Undo/Redo), or 9 (Toolbar & Polish).
- Investigation began around `useCanvasInteractions.ts`; exploratory edits were made but *not* finalized or verified. The current file contains experimental logic for undo management, duplicate/delete operations, and transform handling that was not validated.
- Because the exploratory work was incomplete, **no tests were run** and the feature work remains outstanding.

## What's Been Attempted

- Added scaffolding in `useCanvasInteractions.ts` to:
  - Capture duplicate/delete actions and connect them to a new `useUndoManager` hook.
  - Track transform state with the intent of supporting resize gestures and undoable updates.
  - Hook keyboard shortcuts (⌘/Ctrl+D, ⌘/Ctrl+Z, Shift+⌘/Ctrl+Z) into undo/redo and duplicate actions.
- Created `useUndoManager.ts` to record operations and replay them via Firestore/RTDB helpers. The implementation was not fully verified against the store APIs or Firebase clients.

## Outstanding Work

1. **Audit & Stabilize `useCanvasInteractions.ts`**
   - Confirm the transform state model (move vs resize) still works for basic dragging.
   - Finish resize gesture support, including Konva transformer integration.
   - Validate duplicate/delete flows and confirm Firestore commits remain consistent.

2. **Finalize Undo/Redo Integration**
   - Ensure `useUndoManager` correctly records create/delete/update operations.
   - Wire undo/redo to both keyboard shortcuts and future UI affordances.
   - Add unit tests for undo slice behaviour and the new manager hook.

3. **Implement Toolbar Enhancements (Step 9)**
   - Surface duplicate/delete/undo/redo actions via toolbar buttons and confirm styling.
   - Add any outstanding status indicators or error toasts called for in the PRD.

4. **Testing & Verification**
   - Run targeted manual tests for move/resize/duplicate/delete, undo/redo, and keyboard shortcuts.
   - Execute the existing unit test suite and add coverage for new behaviour.

## Recommendation for Next Owner

- Treat the current `useCanvasInteractions.ts` and `useUndoManager.ts` as work-in-progress. Review diffs carefully to decide whether to continue from this scaffold or revert to the last known good state before re-implementing Steps 7–9.
- Once the implementation is stable, document the completed work in `progress.md`, update the memory bank, and expand automated tests as needed.
