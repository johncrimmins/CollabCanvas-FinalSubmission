## 🚀 Next Steps

### Before Starting Task 2

**User must complete Firebase setup:**

1. Follow `FIREBASE-SETUP.md` to create Firebase project
2. Create `.env.local` with Firebase configuration
3. Restart dev server: `npm run dev`
4. Run through `TESTING-GUIDE.md` to verify everything works

### Task 2: Canvas Page Infrastructure

When ready to continue:
- Set up Zustand store structure
- Create Firebase client wrappers
- Implement canvas route providers
- Test: Canvas page loads, store accessible, Firebase connects

---

## 📝 Key Features Implemented

### Authentication Flow
```
/auth (public) → Sign Up/Login → / (dashboard, protected)
                                ↓
                      /canvases/[id] (protected)
```

### Error Handling
- Missing Firebase config: Helpful error after 3-second timeout
- Invalid credentials: User-friendly messages
- Network errors: Clear guidance
- Loading states: Spinners and disabled buttons

### UI Design
- Gradient backgrounds for depth
- Generous whitespace
- Smooth transitions (200-300ms)
- Premium card styling with shadows
- Connection status indicator
- Toast notifications
